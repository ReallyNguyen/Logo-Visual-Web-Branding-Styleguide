                We have derived our colour scheme from a fusion of the hues present in our galaxy and the
                environment around us.
                By incorporating subtle variations of our primary colours, we aim to elevate the visual appeal of
                our app and provide
                an immersive user experience.

                    the importance of eco-friendly habits; encouraging our users to keep
                    their surroundings clean and free of pollutants.

            Our application will feature a dark-mode interface, where the majority of buttons will be displayed in
            white.
            Texts will seamlessly transition between our primary dark purple color and white, depending on the context
            of each page. Additionally, all other colors will blend together in a gradient, complemented by graphics
            showcasing the beauty of our galaxy on the landing page.

            A few examples of our buttons and menu page has been placed above to show how our primary colours of
            purple and white will be utilized throughout our page. Graphics created in Illustrator will use the fusion
            of yellows,
            greens and orange further enhance the visual appeal of our page.
